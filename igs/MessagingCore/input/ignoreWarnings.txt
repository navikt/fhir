== Suppressed Messages ==

# Required by the IG Publisher, even if no messages are supressed.
# Add warning and/or information messages here after you've confirmed that they aren't really a problem
# (And include comments like this justifying why)
# See https://github.com/FHIR/sample-ig/blob/master/input/ignoreWarnings.txt for examples
